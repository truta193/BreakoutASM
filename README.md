# BreakoutASM
Implemented using the Canvas Framework provided by my University.
The framework is limited to a 200ms clock but I have exploited a bug I found; clicks and keyboard events are not bound to the timer and they both call the draw function.
## Python Script
The provided python script (fpsBoost.py) will make the mouse click at 60Hz when the cursor is on the game's window. To turn it off, press ESC.
